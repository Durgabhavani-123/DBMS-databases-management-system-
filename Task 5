Task 5: Writing Join Queries, Equivalent, and/or Recursive Queries

Case Study: Online Food Ordering System

Objective: To perform advanced query processing and test its heuristics by designing 

optimized complex queries and their equivalent forms, including recursive queries, for the 

Online Food Ordering System.

1. Join Queries

Query 1: Retrieve all orders along with the corresponding customer's name.

Expected Output:

Query 2: Retrieve all menu items along with the restaurant name that offers them.

Expected Output:

Query 3: Retrieve all orders and their delivery status.
Expected Output:

INNER JOIN

An INNER JOIN retrieves records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT OUTER JOIN

A LEFT OUTER JOIN retrieves all records from the left table and the matched records 

from the right table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for columns from the right table.

Query: Retrieve all customers, even those who havenâ€™t placed any orders.

Expected Output:
RIGHT OUTER JOIN

A RIGHT OUTER JOIN retrieves all records from the right table and the matched records 

from the left table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for columns from the left table.

Query: Retrieve all orders and the names of customers who placed them. Include orders 

even if the customer details are missing.

Expected Output:

FULL OUTER JOIN

A FULL OUTER JOIN retrieves all records from both tables. If no
CROSS JOIN

A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of the two tables. Every row from the first 

table is combined with every row from the second table.

Query: Retrieve all possible combinations of customers and menu items.

Expected Output:

SELF JOIN

A SELF JOIN joins a table with itself. It is useful for hierarchical .
